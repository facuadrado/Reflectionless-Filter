# Reflectionless-Filter

I have developed a calculator to calculate the capacitor and inductor values for a Low-pass, high-pass, bandpass and bandstop reflectionless filter from Matthew Morgan's Prototype topology. This is a working in progress proyect. For more information on Matthew Morgan's Reflectionless filter, please refer to the links below:
